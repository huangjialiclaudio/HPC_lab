  abstract = {In this paper we derive and analyze the properties of explicit singly diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) integration methods. We discuss the principles for construction of Runge-Kutta methods with embedded methods of different order for error estimation and continuous extensions for discrete event location. These principles are used to derive a family of ESDIRK integration methods with error estimators and continuous-extensions. The orders of the advancing method (and error estimator) are 1(2), 2(3) and 3(4), respectively. These methods are suitable for obtaining low to medium accuracy solutions of systems of ordinary differential equations as well as index-1 differential algebraic equations. The continuous extensions facilitates solution of hybrid systems with discrete-events. Other ESDIRK methods due to Kv\{\textbackslash ae\}rn\{\textbackslash o\} are equipped with continuous-extensions as well to make them applicable to hybrid systems with discrete events.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents the graphs known as `rooted trees' play a central role in the analysis of the accuracy of Runge-Kutta methods. To investigate the error in carrying out a single step of a Runge-Kutta method, one needs to compare successive terms in the Taylor expansions of the exact and the computed solutions. Having found the Taylor expansion of the exact solution to an initial value problem, one now find the corresponding expansion for the approximation computed by a Runge-Kutta method. Aim of comparing the Taylor expansions of the exact and computed solutions to an initial value problem will give an inconclusive answer unless the terms involving the various elementary differentials can be regarded as independent. The methods of Verner overcome the fault inherent in many of the Fehlberg methods, that the two embedded methods both have the same underlying quadrature formula.},
